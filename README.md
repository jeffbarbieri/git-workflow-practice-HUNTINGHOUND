## Why I found this interesting

Although not entirely correlated with software engineering, I'm intrigued by the potential usage of this technology. Unlike previous efforts, they are able to integrate the technology for senses directly in to the object structure. This opens up a lot of new avenues for the usage of such material. 

I'm also intrigued by their software solution as to where to put the shear cells optimally. I feel like this is a really cool algorithmic question.
