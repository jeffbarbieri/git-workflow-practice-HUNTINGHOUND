## Why I found this interesting

Although not entriely correlated wit sofware engineering, I'm intrigued by the potention usage of this technology. Unlike previous efforts, they are able to integrated the technology for senses directly in the the object struture. This opens up a lot of new avenues for the usage of such material. 

I'm also intrigued by their software solution as to where to put the shear cells optimally. I feel like this is a really cool algorithmic question.
